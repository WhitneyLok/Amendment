   <p class="sp"> It was more of a failure at the beginning until the ratification. In the beginning, The 14th Amendment became so successful because it made society to where everyone has freedom of rights. This Amendment helped abolish slavery as it went away the next 150 years. But as Segregation became a big situation in the 1900’s, the 14th Amendment began to go look Ineffective. Then it was a failure because it failed to give former slaves their rights fully. Although African Americans were granted the legal rights to act as full citizens, they couldn’t do so without being murder. So even though it did stop slavery it did start a new problem for colored people which was segregation. White men believed that African Americans were evil and that they were meant to be servants. Thus if African Americans could not be a slave anymore, then they would have to be “put in their place” by other means. So literacy tests, poll taxes, and other aspects prevented blacks from voting and it wasn’t until the Civil Rights Movement that ratification of the amendment became effective in any real way. </p>
